# Transformer Health Analysis

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to the health assessment of measurement transformers. The analysis focuses on gas concentrations and electrical properties critical to evaluating transformer condition and performance.

## Dataset
- **Health index2.csv**: Contains columns such as Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Methane, CO, CO2, Ethylene, Ethane, Acetylene, DBDS, Power Factor, Interfacial V, Dielectric Rigidity, Water Content, and Health Index.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize data to understand distributions.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore relationships and trends through plots.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify key indicators of transformer health.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect unusual patterns indicating potential issues.

## Files
- **Health index2.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.
- **EDA on Health Index Of Transformer.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the EDA.
- **[eda_report.pdf](report/eda_report.pdf)**: PDF report summarizing the EDA findings.

## Expected Outcomes
- Insights into the relationship between gas concentrations, electrical properties, and transformer health.
- Visualizations and statistical summaries of critical patterns and trends.
- Identification of key features influencing the Health Index.
